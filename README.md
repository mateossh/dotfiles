# dotfiles

## Notes

1. i3 config is moved from `dotfiles-old` repository (not existing anymore) and last modification was made 2 years ago. It might doesn't work right now.
2. Some things needs to be fixed like ncmpcpp and openbox config.
3. Finally I made own vimrc by myself. YAY!
4. Nowadays I use openbox. Bspwm and i3 configs are outdated.
